Full-Stack Web Application#
LlamaIndex can be integrated into a downstream full-stack web application. It can be used in a backend server (such as Flask), packaged into a Docker container, and/or directly used in a framework such as Streamlit.
We provide tutorials and resources to help you get started in this area:
Fullstack Application Guide shows you how to build an app with LlamaIndex as an API and a TypeScript+React frontend
Fullstack Application with Delphic walks you through using LlamaIndex with a production-ready web app starter template called Delphic.
The LlamaIndex Starter Pack provides very basic flask, streamlit, and docker examples for LlamaIndex.
