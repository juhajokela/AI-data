Putting It All Together#
Congratulations! You’ve loaded your data, indexed it, stored your index, and queried your index. Now you’ve got to ship something to production. We can show you how to do that!
In Q&A Patterns we’ll go into some of the more advanced and subtle ways you can build a query engine beyond the basics.
The terms definition tutorial is a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on creating a subtle query application including defining your prompts and supporting images as input.
We have a guide to creating a unified query framework over your indexes which shows you how to run queries across multiple indexes.
We talk about how to build queries over knowledge graphs
And also over structured data like SQL

We have a guide on how to build a chatbot
We talk about building agents in LlamaIndex
And last but not least we show you how to build a full stack web application using LlamaIndex
LlamaIndex also provides some tools / project templates to help you build a full-stack template. For instance,
create-llama spins up a full-stack scaffold for you.
Check out our Full-Stack Projects page for more details.
We also have the
llamaindex-cli rag CLI tool that combines some of the above concepts into an easy to use tool for chatting with files from your terminal!
