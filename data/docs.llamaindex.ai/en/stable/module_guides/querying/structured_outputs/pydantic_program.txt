Pydantic Program#
A pydantic program is a generic abstraction that takes in an input string and converts it to a structured Pydantic object type.
Because this abstraction is so generic, it encompasses a broad range of LLM workflows. The programs are composable and be for more generic or specific use cases.
There’s a few general types of Pydantic Programs:
LLM Text Completion Pydantic Programs: These convert input text into a user-specified structured object through a text completion API + output parsing.
LLM Function Calling Pydantic Program: These convert input text into a user-specified structured object through an LLM function calling API.
Prepackaged Pydantic Programs: These convert input text into prespecified structured objects.
