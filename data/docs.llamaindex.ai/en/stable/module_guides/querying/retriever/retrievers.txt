Retriever Modules#
We are actively adding more tailored retrieval guides. In the meanwhile, please take a look at the API References.
Index Retrievers#
Please see the retriever modes for more details on how to get a retriever from any given index.
If you want to import the corresponding retrievers directly, please check out our API reference.
Comprehensive Retriever Guides#
Check out our comprehensive guides on various retriever modules, many of which cover advanced concepts (auto-retrieval, routing, ensembling, and more).
Advanced Retrieval and Search#
These guides contain advanced retrieval techniques. Some are common like keyword/hybrid search, reranking, and more. Some are specific to LLM + RAG pipelines, like small-to-big and auto-merging retrieval.
Auto-Retrieval#
These retrieval techniques perform semi-structured queries, combining semantic search with structured filtering.
Knowledge Graph Retrievers#
Composed Retrievers#
These are retrieval techniques that are composed on top of other retrieval techniques - providing higher-level capabilities like hierarchical retrieval and query decomposition.
Managed Retrievers#
Other Retrievers#
These are guides that donâ€™t fit neatly into a category but should be highlighted regardless.
