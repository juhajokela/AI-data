Vector Stores#
Vector stores contain embedding vectors of ingested document chunks (and sometimes the document chunks as well).
Simple Vector Store#
By default, LlamaIndex uses a simple in-memory vector store thatâ€™s great for quick experimentation.
They can be persisted to (and loaded from) disk by calling
vector_store.persist() (and
SimpleVectorStore.from_persist_path(...) respectively).
Vector Store Options & Feature Support#
LlamaIndex supports over 20 different vector store options. We are actively adding more integrations and improving feature coverage for each.
For more details, see Vector Store Integrations.
