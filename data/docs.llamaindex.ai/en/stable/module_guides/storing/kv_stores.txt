Key-Value Stores#
Key-Value stores are the underlying storage abstractions that power our Document Stores and Index Stores.
We provide the following key-value stores:
Simple Key-Value Store: An in-memory KV store. The user can choose to call
persiston this kv store to persist data to disk.
MongoDB Key-Value Store: A MongoDB KV store.
See the API Reference for more details.
Note: At the moment, these storage abstractions are not externally facing.
