Tools#
Concept#
Having proper tool abstractions is at the core of building data agents. Defining a set of Tools is similar to defining any API interface, with the exception that these Tools are meant for agent rather than human use. We allow users to define both a Tool as well as a ToolSpec containing a series of functions under the hood.
A Tool implements a very generic interface - simply define
__call__ and also return some basic metadata (name, description, function schema).
A Tool Spec defines a full API specification of any service that can be converted into a list of Tools.
We offer a few different types of Tools:
FunctionTool: A function tool allows users to easily convert any user-defined function into a Tool. It can also auto-infer the function schema.
QueryEngineTool: A tool that wraps an existing query engine. Note: since our agent abstractions inherit from
BaseQueryEngine, these tools can also wrap other agents.
We offer a rich set of Tools and Tool Specs through LlamaHub 🦙.
Usage Pattern#
Our Tool Specs and Tools can be imported from the
llama-hub package.
To use with our agent,
from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent
from llama_index.tools.google import GmailToolSpec
tool_spec = GmailToolSpec()
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tool_spec.to_tool_list(), verbose=True)
See our Usage Pattern Guide for more details.
