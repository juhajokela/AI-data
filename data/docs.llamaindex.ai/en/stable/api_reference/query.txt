Querying an Index#
This doc shows the classes that are used to query indices.
Main Query Classes#
Querying an index involves three main components:
Retrievers: A retriever class retrieves a set of Nodes from an index given a query.
Response Synthesizer: This class takes in a set of Nodes and synthesizes an answer given a query.
Query Engine: This class takes in a query and returns a Response object. It can make use of Retrievers and Response Synthesizer modules under the hood.
Chat Engines: This class enables conversation over a knowledge base. It is the stateful version of a query engine that keeps track of conversation history.
Additional Query Classes#
We also detail some additional query classes below.
- Query Bundle: This is the input to the query classes: retriever, response synthesizer,
and query engine. It enables the user to customize the string(s) used for embedding-based query.
- Query Transform: This class augments a raw query string with
associated transformations to improve index querying. Can be used with a Retriever (see TransformRetriever) or QueryEngine.
