Using Graph Stores#
Neo4jGraphStore#
Neo4j is supported as a graph store integration. You can persist, visualize, and query graphs using LlamaIndex and Neo4j. Furthermore, existing Neo4j graphs are directly supported using
text2cypher and the
KnowledgeGraphQueryEngine.
If youâ€™ve never used Neo4j before, you can download the desktop client here.
Once you open the client, create a new project and install the
apoc integration. Full instructions here. Just click on your project, select
Plugins on the left side menu, install APOC and restart your server.
