Multi-Modal LLM using OpenAI GPT-4V model for image reasoning#
In this notebook, we show how to use OpenAI GPT4V MultiModal LLM class/abstraction for image understanding/reasoning.
We also show several functions we are now supporting for OpenAI GPT4V LLM:
complete(both sync and async): for a single prompt and list of images
chat(both sync and async): for multiple chat messages
stream complete(both sync and async): for steaming output of complete
stream chat(both sync and async): for steaming output of chat
%pip install llama-index-multi-modal-llms-openai
!pip install openai matplotlib

The image shows the Colosseum in Rome illuminated at night with the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. The ancient amphitheater's multiple arches are vividly lit, contrasting with the dark blue sky in the background. Some construction or restoration work appears to be in progress at the base of the structure, and a few people can be seen walking near the site.

This image shows the Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, which is an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is located in the center of Rome, Italy. It is one of the world's most famous landmarks and is considered one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering.
The Colosseum is illuminated at night with the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. This lighting could be for a special occasion or event, such as a national holiday, a cultural celebration, or in solidarity with a cause. The use of lighting to display the national colors is a way to highlight the structure's significance to Italy and its people.
The Colosseum was built in the first century AD under the emperors of the Flavian dynasty and was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. It could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators and was used for entertainment in the Roman Empire for over 400 years.
Today, the Colosseum is a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year. It also serves as a powerful reminder of the Roman Empire's history and its lasting influence on the world.

assistant: I apologize for the confusion earlier. The image actually shows the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, illuminated at night with the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. The ancient amphitheater is captured in a twilight setting, with the sky transitioning from blue to black. The lighting accentuates the arches and the texture of the stone, creating a dramatic and colorful display. There are some people and a street visible in the foreground, with construction barriers indicating some ongoing work or preservation efforts.

assistant: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let me provide you with an accurate description of the image you've provided.
The image shows the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, illuminated at night with the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. The ancient amphitheater is captured in a moment of twilight, with the sky transitioning from blue to black, highlighting the structure's iconic arches and the illuminated colors. There are some people and a street visible in the foreground, with construction barriers indicating some ongoing work or preservation efforts. The Colosseum's grandeur and historical significance are emphasized by the lighting and the dusk setting.
Async stream Chat#

image_documents_1 = load_image_urls(image_urls)
response_multi = openai_mm_llm.complete(
prompt="is there any relationship between those images?",
image_documents=image_documents_1,
)
print(response_multi)
No, there is no direct relationship between these two images. The first image is an infographic showing the surge in U.S. mortgage rates and its comparison with existing home sales, indicating economic data. The second image is of a person holding a trophy, which seems to be related to a sports achievement or recognition. The content of the two images pertains to entirely different subjects—one is focused on economic information, while the other is related to an individual's achievement in a likely sporting context.
Use GPT4V to understand images from local files#
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader
# put your local directore here
image_documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./images_wiki").load_data()
response = openai_mm_llm.complete(
prompt="Describe the images as an alternative text",
image_documents=image_documents,
)
from PIL import Image

print(response)
You are looking at a close-up image of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. The label on the bottle features the iconic Coca-Cola logo with additional text underneath it commemorating the 2002 FIFA World Cup hosted by Korea/Japan. The label also indicates that the bottle contains 250 ml of the product. In the background with a shallow depth of field, you can see the blurred image of another Coca-Cola bottle, emphasizing the focus on the one in the foreground. The overall lighting and detail provide a clear view of the bottle and its labeling.
