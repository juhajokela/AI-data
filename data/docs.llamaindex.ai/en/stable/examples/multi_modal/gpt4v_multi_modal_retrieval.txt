Advanced Multi-Modal Retrieval using GPT4V and Multi-Modal Index/Retriever#
In this notebook, we show how to build a Multi-Modal retrieval system using LlamaIndex with GPT4-V and CLIP.
LlamaIndex Multi-Modal Retrieval
Text embedding index: Generate GPT text embeddings
Images embedding index: CLIP embeddings from OpenAI for images
Encoding queries:
Encode query text for text index using ada
Encode query text for image index using CLIP
Framework: LlamaIndex
Steps:
Using Multi-Modal LLM GPT4V class to undertand multiple images
Download texts, images, pdf raw files from related Wikipedia articles and SEC 10K report
Build Multi-Modal index and vetor store for both texts and images
Retrieve relevant text and image simultaneously using Multi-Modal Retriver according to the image reasoning from Step 1

Generate image reasoning from GPT4V Multi-Modal LLM#
Plot input images#
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
image_paths = []
for img_path in os.listdir("./input_images"):
image_paths.append(str(os.path.join("./input_images", img_path)))
def plot_images(image_paths):
images_shown = 0
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 9))
for img_path in image_paths:
if os.path.isfile(img_path):
image = Image.open(img_path)
plt.subplot(2, 3, images_shown + 1)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.xticks([])
plt.yticks([])
images_shown += 1
if images_shown >= 9:
break
plot_images(image_paths)
Using GPT4V to understand those input images#
from llama_index.multi_modal_llms.openai import OpenAIMultiModal
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader
# put your local directore here
image_documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./input_images").load_data()
openai_mm_llm = OpenAIMultiModal(
model="gpt-4-vision-preview", api_key=OPENAI_API_TOKEN, max_new_tokens=1500
)
response_1 = openai_mm_llm.complete(
prompt="Describe the images as an alternative text",
image_documents=image_documents,
)
print(response_1)
The images depict information and specifications about electric vehicles, presumably from a car manufacturer's website.
Image 1:
This image contains text that lists specifications for two different car models, one with Rear-Wheel Drive and the other with Long Range AWD (All-Wheel Drive). Categories covered include Battery, Weight, Acceleration, Range, Top Speed, Drive, Seating, Wheels, and Warranty.
Image 2:
This image shows a cutaway illustration of an electric vehicle highlighting its structural components. The car is rendered to show its internal features such as rigid structure and impact protection zones.
Image 3:
Similar to the first image, this image contains text showing specifications for two variants of what appears to be the same model of electric vehicle, with one being a performance model and the other Long Range AWD. The specs include Battery, Acceleration, Range, Drive, Seating, Wheels, Display, Tire Type, Supercharging Max/Power, and Warranty.
Image 4:
The image presents pricing and potential savings information for different variants of an electric vehicle model. It includes a federal incentive notice, an area to enter a delivery postal code, purchase price for different versions (Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive, Model Y Long Range, Model Y Performance), and additional feature details. There's also a note about potential savings over gas at the bottom.
Image 5:
This image lists specifications for electric vehicles, focused on two categories: Performance and Long Range AWD. Specs listed include Battery, Acceleration, Range, Top Speed, Drive, Seating, Wheels, Display, Tire Type, Supercharging Max/Power, and Warranty.
Each of these images would be used to provide customers with information regarding electric car models, their features, capabilities, pricing, and potential savings.
response_2 = openai_mm_llm.complete(
prompt="Can you tell me what is the price with each spec?",
image_documents=image_documents,
)
print(response_2)
The images you've provided appear to be from a car manufacturer's website, showing different specifications for an electric vehicle and the associated prices for different trim levels or configurations of the vehicle. However, since the actual text content for the price per specification is not fully legible in the images provided, I can't give you precise pricing information. Generally, these types of websites often list the following trims with increasing features and therefore increasing prices:
1. Rear-Wheel Drive (Standard Range or Long Range)
2. Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (often dubbed Long Range AWD)
3. Performance (typically comes with the most features and fastest acceleration)
Features like acceleration times, range, top speed, curb weight, cargo volume, seating capacity, display type, drive type, wheels size, warranty, and others can vary by trim level. The images show that there are different specs for the "Performance" and "Long Range AWD" trims such as acceleration, range, top speed, and potentially others related to power and luxury features.
The final image provided shows some pricing details:
- Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive: $57,990
- Model 3 Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive: $67,990
- Model 3 Performance: $74,990
These prices might be eligible for certain incentives, as indicated by a "$5,000 Federal Incentive" notice, which would effectively reduce the purchase price, though this depends on individual eligibility and local laws.
Please proactively check the manufacturer’s website or reach out to an official dealership for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding pricing and specifications for these vehicle trims.

Retrieve and query texts and images from our Multi-Modal Index#
We show two examples leveraging multi-modal retrieval.
Retrieval-Augmented Captioning: In the first example, we perform multi-modal retrieval based on an existing image caption, to return more relevant context. We can then continue to query the LLM for related vehicles.
Multi-modal RAG Querying: In the second example, given a user-query, we first retrieve a mix of both text and images, and feed it to an LLM for synthesis.
2. Multi-Modal RAG Querying#
from llama_index.core import PromptTemplate
from llama_index.core.query_engine import SimpleMultiModalQueryEngine
qa_tmpl_str = (
"Context information is below.\n"
"---------------------\n"
"{context_str}\n"
"---------------------\n"
"Given the context information and not prior knowledge, "
"answer the query.\n"
"Query: {query_str}\n"
"Answer: "
)
qa_tmpl = PromptTemplate(qa_tmpl_str)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
multi_modal_llm=openai_mm_llm, text_qa_template=qa_tmpl
)
query_str = "Tell me more about the Porsche"
response = query_engine.query(query_str)
print(str(response))
The Porsche Taycan represents a significant step for Porsche as their first series production electric car. The Taycan model line includes a diverse range of variants: from the more affordable base rear-wheel-drive (RWD) model to the high-performance all-wheel-drive (AWD) Turbo and Turbo S models. The Taycan is not limited to just the 4-door saloon format but has expanded to include estate variations such as the Taycan Cross Turismo and the Taycan Sport Turismo.
The interior of the Taycan is a showcase of Porsche's commitment to modernity and technology, with up to four digital displays for instrumentation and infotainment, while still retaining iconic features like the classic Porsche clock. The exterior design is a tribute to Porsche's heritage with contemporary touches, maintaining the brand's visual language.
Performance-wise, the Taycan offers different power options, with the most powerful Turbo and Turbo S variants reaching 460 kW (617 hp) under specific conditions like overboost power with launch control mode. The Taycan's design incorporates advanced features like a retractable rear spoiler and door handles, and it utilizes a regenerative braking system to optimize efficiency.
The Taycan has not only impressed customers and the automotive market but has also earned accolades from prestigious entities, with the 4S model being named Performance Car of the Year by What Car? magazine, and the Taycan Cross Turismo gaining recognition as Best Estate in the Top Gear Electric Awards.
Moreover, the concept cars that previewed the Taycan, specifically the Porsche Mission E and the Mission E Cross Turismo, pointed toward Porsche's electric future and set a benchmark in the electric vehicle market for design and performance expectations. The Mission E concept set ambitious goals for range and charging time, leveraging an 800 V DC system voltage for rapid charging capabilities.
Overall, the Porsche Taycan is a blend of traditional Porsche DNA and forward-looking electric vehicle technology, epitomizing high performance, luxury, and sustainability in a package that appeals to both loyal customers and a new generation seeking electric alternatives.
