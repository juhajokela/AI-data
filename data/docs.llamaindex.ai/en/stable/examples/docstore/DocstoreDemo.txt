Docstore Demo#
This guide shows you how to directly use our
DocumentStore abstraction. By putting nodes in the docstore, this allows you to define multiple indices over the same underlying docstore, instead of duplicating data across indices.
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

!pip install llama-index

Download Data#
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'
!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'
Load Documents#
reader = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/")
documents = reader.load_data()
Parse into Nodes#
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
nodes = SentenceSplitter().get_nodes_from_documents(documents)
Add to Docstore#
from llama_index.core.storage.docstore import SimpleDocumentStore
docstore = SimpleDocumentStore()
docstore.add_documents(nodes)
Define Multiple Indexes#
Each index uses the same underlying Node.
from llama_index.core import StorageContext
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(docstore=docstore)
summary_index = SummaryIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)
keyword_table_index = SimpleKeywordTableIndex(
nodes, storage_context=storage_context
)
# NOTE: the docstore sitll has the same nodes
len(storage_context.docstore.docs)

After his time at YC, the author decided to take a break and focus on painting. He spent most of 2014 painting and then, in November, he ran out of steam and stopped. He then moved to Florence, Italy to attend the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze, where he studied painting and drawing. He also started painting still lives in his bedroom at night. In March 2015, he started working on Lisp again and wrote a new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. He wrote essays through 2020, but also started to think about other things he could work on. He wrote an essay for himself to answer the question of how he should choose what to do next and then wrote a more detailed version for others to read. He also created the Y Combinator logo, which was an inside joke referencing the Viaweb logo, a white V on a red circle, so he made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square. He also created a fund for YC for a couple of years, but after Heroku got bought, he had enough money to go back to being self-funded. He also disliked the term "deal flow" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time
