LongContextReorder#
Models struggle to access significant details found in the center of extended contexts. A study observed that the best performance typically arises when crucial data is positioned at the start or conclusion of the input context. Additionally, as the input context lengthens, performance drops notably, even in models designed for long contexts.
This module will re-order the retrieved nodes, which can be helpful in cases where a large top-k is needed.
Setup#
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

!pip install llama-index
import os
import openai
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.core import Settings
Settings.llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", temperature=0.1)

Download Data
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'

Run Query#
from llama_index.core.postprocessor import LongContextReorder
reorder = LongContextReorder()
reorder_engine = index.as_query_engine(
node_postprocessors=[reorder], similarity_top_k=5
)
base_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=5)
from llama_index.core.response.notebook_utils import display_response
base_response = base_engine.query("Did the author meet Sam Altman?")
display_response(base_response)
Final Response: Yes, the author met Sam Altman when they asked him to be the president of Y Combinator. This was during the time when the author was in a PhD program in computer science and also pursuing their passion for art. They were applying to art schools and eventually ended up attending RISD.
reorder_response = reorder_engine.query("Did the author meet Sam Altman?")
display_response(reorder_response)
Final Response: Yes, the author met Sam Altman when they asked him to be the president of Y Combinator. This meeting occurred at a party at the authorâ€™s house, where they were introduced by a mutual friend, Jessica Livingston. Jessica later went on to compile a book of interviews with startup founders, and the author shared their thoughts on the flaws of venture capital with her during her job search at a Boston VC firm.
