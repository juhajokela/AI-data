Colbert Rerank#
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
Colbert: ColBERT is a fast and accurate retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds.
This example shows how we use Colbert-V2 model as a reranker.
