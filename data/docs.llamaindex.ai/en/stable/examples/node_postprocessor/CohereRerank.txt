Final Response: Sam Altman agreed to become the president of Y
Combinator in October 2013. He took over starting with the winter 2014
batch, and worked with the founders to help them get through Demo Day
in March 2014. He then reorganised Y Combinator to be controlled by
someone other than the founders, so that it could last for a long
time.

Text: day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,
Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited
advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at
Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested
that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That
was what it ...

experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a

Final Response: Sam Altman was one of the founders of Y Combinator, a
startup accelerator. He was part of the first batch of startups funded
by Y Combinator, which included Reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear's
Twitch, and Aaron Swartz. He was also involved in the Summer Founders
Program, which was a summer program where undergrads could start their
own startups instead of taking a summer job at a tech company. He also
helped to develop a new version of Arc, a programming language, and
wrote a book on Lisp.

Text: at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint,
and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around
Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a
big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned
in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more
