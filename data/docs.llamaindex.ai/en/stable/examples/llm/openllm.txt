OpenLLM#
There are two ways to interface with LLMs from OpenLLM.
Through
openllmpackage if you want to run locally: use
llama_index.llms.OpenLLM
If there is a running OpenLLM Server, then it will wraps openllm-client: use
llama_index.llms.OpenLLMAPI
There are many possible permutations of these two, so this notebook only details a few. See OpenLLMâ€™s README for more information
In the below line, we install the packages necessary for this demo:
openllm[vllm]is needed for
OpenLLMif you have access to GPU, otherwise
openllm
openllm-clientis needed for
OpenLLMAPI
The quotes are needed for Z shell (
zsh)
%pip install llama-index-llms-openllm
!pip install "openllm" # use 'openllm[vllm]' if you have access to GPU
Now that weâ€™re set up, letâ€™s play around:
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
!pip install llama-index
import os
from typing import List, Optional
from llama_index.llms.openllm import OpenLLM, OpenLLMAPI
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
os.environ[
"OPENLLM_ENDPOINT"
] = "na" # Change this to a remote server that you might run OpenLLM at.
# This uses https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha
# downloaded (if first invocation) to the local Hugging Face model cache,
# and actually runs the model on your local machine's hardware
local_llm = OpenLLM("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha")
# This will use the model running on the server at localhost:3000
remote_llm = OpenLLMAPI(address="http://localhost:3000")
# Note here you don't have to pass in the address if OPENLLM_ENDPOINT environment variable is set
# address if not pass is address=os.getenv("OPENLLM_ENDPOINT")
remote_llm = OpenLLMAPI()
Underlying a completion with
OpenLLM supports continuous batching with vLLM
completion_response = remote_llm.complete("To infinity, and")
print(completion_response)

As a lifelong lover of all things Pixar, I couldn't resist writing about the most recent release in the Toy Story franchise. Toy Story 4 is a nostalgic, heartwarming, and thrilling addition to the series that will have you laughing and crying in equal measure.
The movie follows Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and the rest of the gang as they embark on a road trip with their new owner, Bonnie. However, things take an unexpected turn when Woody meets Bo Peep (Annie Pot
OpenLLM and
OpenLLMAPI also supports streaming, synchronous and asynchronous for

often a topic of philosophical debate. Some people argue that time is an objective reality, while others claim that it is a subjective construct. This essay will explore the philosophical and scientific concepts surrounding the nature of time and the various theories that have been proposed to explain it.
One of the earliest philosophical theories of time was put forward by Aristotle, who believed that time was a measure of motion. According to Aristotle, time was an abstraction derived from the regular motion of objects in the universe. This theory was later refined by Galileo and Newton, who introduced the concept of time
They also support chat API as well,
chat,
stream_chat,
achat, and
astream_chat:
async for it in remote_llm.astream_chat(
[
ChatMessage(
role="system", content="You are acting as Ernest Hemmingway."
),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hi there!"),
ChatMessage(role="assistant", content="Yes?"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is the meaning of life?"),
]
):
print(it.message.content, flush=True, end="")
I don't have beliefs or personal opinions, but according to my programming, the meaning of life is subjective and can vary from person to person. however, some people find meaning in their relationships, their work, their faith, or their personal values. ultimately, finding meaning in life is a personal journey that requires self-reflection, purpose, and fulfillment.
