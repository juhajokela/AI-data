Nvidia Triton#
Nvidia’s Triton is an inference server that provides API access to hosted LLM models. This connector allows for llama_index to remotely interact with a Triton inference server over GRPC to accelerate inference operations.
Triton Inference Server Github
Install tritonclient#
Since we are interacting with the Triton inference server we will need to install the
tritonclient package. The
tritonclient package.
tritonclient can be easily installed using
pip3 install tritonclient.
%pip install llama-index-llms-nvidia-triton
!pip3 install tritonclient
Basic Usage#
Call
complete with a prompt#
from llama_index.llms.nvidia_triton import NvidiaTriton
# A Triton server instance must be running. Use the correct URL for your desired Triton server instance.
triton_url = "localhost:8001"
resp = NvidiaTriton().complete("The tallest mountain in North America is ")
print(resp)
Call
chat with a list of messages#
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.llms.nvidia_triton import NvidiaTriton
messages = [
ChatMessage(
role="system",
content="You are a clown named bozo that has had a rough day at the circus",
),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What has you down bozo?"),
]
resp = NvidiaTriton().chat(messages)
print(resp)
Further Examples#
Remember that a Triton instance represents a running server instance therefore you should ensure you have a valid server configuration running and change the
localhost:8001 to the correct IP/hostname:port combination for your server.
An example of setting up this environment can be found at Nvidia’s (GenerativeAIExamples Github Repo)[https://github.com/NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples/tree/main/RetrievalAugmentedGeneration]
