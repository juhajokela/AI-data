Anthropic#
Anthropic has recently released its latest models:
Claude 3 Opus,
Claude 3 Sonnet, and
Claude 3 Haiku (which will be available soon). By default, the
claude-2.1 model is used. This notebook provides guidance on how to utilize these new models.
Claude 3 Opus - claude-3-opus-20240229
Claude 3 Sonnet - claude-3-sonnet-20240229
Claude 3 Haiku - Coming soon
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
%pip install llama-index-llms-anthropic
!pip install llama-index
Set Tokenizer#
First we want to set the tokenizer, which is slightly different than TikToken.
NOTE: The Claude 3 tokenizer has not been updated yet; using the existing Anthropic tokenizer leads to context overflow errors for 200k tokens. Weâ€™ve temporarily set the max tokens for Claude 3 to 180k.

assistant: *clears throat and speaks in a pirate accent* Aye, gather 'round me hearties and I'll spin ye a yarn of adventure on the high seas!
T'was a dark and stormy night when the Black Pearl set sail from Tortuga. The salty sea spray stung me eyes as I stood at the helm, guidin' me beloved ship through the roilin' waves. Me loyal crew scurried about, securin' the riggin' and battening down the hatches.
Suddenly, the lookout cried "Ship ahoy!" and pointed off the starboard bow. I raised me spyglass and spied a Spanish galleon, her decks heavily laden with treasure. The crew gave a hearty cheer - we'd be feastin' and drinkin' well tonight!
I ordered the crew to ready the cannons as we drew alongside the galleon. "Fire all!" I bellowed and the Pearl shook as the guns unleashed a barrage. The Spaniards returned fire but they were no match for me skilled gunners.
We boarded the galleon, swords flashin' and pistols blazin'. The fight was fast and bloody but in the end, the Pearl was victorious! We claimed the treasure as our own - mountains of gold and jewels glintin' in the moonlight.
As we sailed away, I couldn't help but grin. T'was a fine night of piratin' and I knew many more adventures lay ahead for me and me crew. No matter the danger, the Black Pearl would always prevail! Yo ho ho!
*laughs heartily* And that, me friends, is a taste of the pirate's life. May yer sails always be full and yer horizons bright. Fare thee well!

*clears throat and speaks in a gruff, piratey voice*
Aye, gather 'round me hearties and I'll spin ye a yarn of adventure on the high seas!
'Twas a dark and stormy night, the kind where the wind howls like a banshee and the waves crash over the deck. Me and me crew were sailin' the Caribbean, searchin' for treasure and glory.
Suddenly, the lookout cried "Ship ahoy!" and sure enough, a Spanish galleon was bearin' down on us, her decks bristlin' with cannons. The scurvy dogs wanted our gold, but I'd sooner walk the plank than surrender!
"All hands to battle stations!" I bellowed. "Ready the cannons and prepare to board!"
A mighty battle erupted, cannons boomin' and swords clashin'. We swung over on ropes and fought the Spaniards hand-to-hand on the pitchin' and rollin' deck. Me cutlass was a blur as I dueled their captain, a big brute with a wicked scar.
Finally, I drove me blade into that bilge rat's black heart and he fell dead at me feet. His crew surrendered and we took their ship as a prize. In the hold, we found chests overflowing with gold doubloons and jewels - a king's ransom!
We sailed off into the sunset, our pirate flag snappin' in the breeze, flush with coin and the thrill of victory. And that, me buckos, is a taste of the pirate life! Now who wants some grog?
*laughs heartily*
