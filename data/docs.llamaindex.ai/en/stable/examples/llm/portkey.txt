-
To harness these features, let‚Äôs start with the setup:
If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.
%pip install llama-index-llms-portkey
!pip install llama-index
# Installing Llamaindex & Portkey SDK
!pip install -U llama_index
!pip install -U portkey-ai
# Importing necessary libraries and modules
from llama_index.llms.portkey import Portkey
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
import portkey as pk
You do not need to install any other SDKs or import them in your Llamaindex app.
Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Get your Portkey API Key and your Virtual Keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and more#
Portkey API Key: Log into Portkey here, then click on the profile icon on top left and ‚ÄúCopy API Key‚Äù.
import os
os.environ["PORTKEY_API_KEY"] = "PORTKEY_API_KEY"
Navigate to the ‚ÄúVirtual Keys‚Äù page on Portkey dashboard and hit the ‚ÄúAdd Key‚Äù button located at the top right corner.
Choose your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace, etc.), assign a unique name to your key, and, if needed, jot down any relevant usage notes. Your virtual key is ready!
openai_virtual_key_a = ""
openai_virtual_key_b = ""
anthropic_virtual_key_a = ""
anthropic_virtual_key_b = ""
cohere_virtual_key_a = ""
cohere_virtual_key_b = ""
If you don‚Äôt want to use Portkey‚Äôs Virtual keys, you can also use your AI provider keys directly.
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = ""
Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Configure Portkey Features#
To harness the full potential of Portkey‚Äôs integration with Llamaindex, you can configure various features as illustrated above. Here‚Äôs a guide to all Portkey features and the expected values:
api_keyand
modeare required values.
You can set your Portkey API key using the Portkey constructor or you can also set it as an environment variable.
There are 3 modes - Single, Fallback, Loadbalance.
Single - This is the standard mode. Use it if you do not want Fallback OR Loadbalance features.
Fallback - Set this mode if you want to enable the Fallback feature. Check out the guide here.
Loadbalance - Set this mode if you want to enable the Loadbalance feature. Check out the guide here.
-
Here‚Äôs an example of how to set up some of these features:
portkey_client = Portkey(
mode="single",
)
# Since we have defined the Portkey API Key with os.environ, we do not need to set api_key again here
Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Constructing the LLM#
With the Portkey integration, constructing an LLM is simplified. Use the
LLMOptions function for all providers, with the exact same keys you‚Äôre accustomed to in your OpenAI or Anthropic constructors. The only new key is
weight, essential for the load balancing feature.
openai_llm = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-4",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
)
The above code illustrates how to utilize the
LLMOptions function to set up an LLM with the OpenAI provider and the GPT-4 model. This same function can be used for other providers as well, making the integration process streamlined and consistent across various providers.
Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Activate the Portkey Client#
Once you‚Äôve constructed the LLM using the
LLMOptions function, the next step is to activate it with Portkey. This step is essential to ensure that all the Portkey features are available for your LLM.
portkey_client.add_llms(openai_llm)
And, that‚Äôs it! In just 4 steps, you have infused your Llamaindex app with sophisticated production capabilities.
üîß Testing the Integration#
Let‚Äôs ensure that everything is set up correctly. Below, we create a simple chat scenario and pass it through our Portkey client to see the response.
messages = [
ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What can you do?"),
]
print("Testing Portkey Llamaindex integration:")
response = portkey_client.chat(messages)
print(response)
Here‚Äôs how your logs will appear on your Portkey dashboard:
‚è© Streaming Responses#
With Portkey, streaming responses has never been more straightforward. Portkey has 4 response functions:
.complete(prompt)
.stream_complete(prompt)
.chat(messages)
.stream_chat(messages)
While the
complete function expects a string input(
str), the
chat function works with an array of
ChatMessage objects.
Example usage:
# Let's set up a prompt and then use the stream_complete function to obtain a streamed response.
prompt = "Why is the sky blue?"
print("\nTesting Stream Complete:\n")
response = portkey_client.stream_complete(prompt)
for i in response:
print(i.delta, end="", flush=True)
# Let's prepare a set of chat messages and then utilize the stream_chat function to achieve a streamed chat response.
messages = [
ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What can you do?"),
]
print("\nTesting Stream Chat:\n")
response = portkey_client.stream_chat(messages)
for i in response:
print(i.delta, end="", flush=True)
üîç Recap and References#
Congratulations! üéâ You‚Äôve successfully set up and tested the Portkey integration with Llamaindex. To recap the steps:
pip install portkey-ai
from llama_index.llms import Portkey
Grab your Portkey API Key and create your virtual provider keys from here.
Construct your Portkey client and set mode:
portkey_client=Portkey(mode="fallback")
Construct your provider LLM with LLMOptions:
openai_llm = pk.LLMOptions(provider="openai", model="gpt-4", virtual_key=openai_key_a)
Add the LLM to Portkey with
portkey_client.add_llms(openai_llm)
Call the Portkey methods regularly like you would any other LLM, with
portkey_client.chat(messages)
Here‚Äôs the guide to all the functions and their params:
üîÅ Implementing Fallbacks and Retries with Portkey#
Fallbacks and retries are essential for building resilient AI applications. With Portkey, implementing these features is straightforward:
Fallbacks: If a primary service or model fails, Portkey will automatically switch to a backup model.
Retries: If a request fails, Portkey can be configured to retry the request multiple times.
Below, we demonstrate how to set up fallbacks and retries using Portkey:
portkey_client = Portkey(mode="fallback")
messages = [
ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What can you do?"),
]
llm1 = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-4",
retry_settings={"on_status_codes": [429, 500], "attempts": 2},
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
)
llm2 = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_b,
)
portkey_client.add_llms(llm_params=[llm1, llm2])
print("Testing Fallback & Retry functionality:")
response = portkey_client.chat(messages)
print(response)
‚öñÔ∏è Implementing Load Balancing with Portkey#
Load balancing ensures that incoming requests are efficiently distributed among multiple models. This not only enhances the performance but also provides redundancy in case one model fails.
With Portkey, implementing load balancing is simple. You need to:
Define the
weightparameter for each LLM. This weight determines how requests are distributed among the LLMs.
Ensure that the sum of weights for all LLMs equals 1.
Here‚Äôs an example of setting up load balancing with Portkey:
portkey_client = Portkey(mode="ab_test")
messages = [
ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What can you do?"),
]
llm1 = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-4",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
weight=0.2,
)
llm2 = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
weight=0.8,
)
portkey_client.add_llms(llm_params=[llm1, llm2])
print("Testing Loadbalance functionality:")
response = portkey_client.chat(messages)
print(response)
üß† Implementing Semantic Caching with Portkey#
Semantic caching is a smart caching mechanism that understands the context of a request. Instead of caching based solely on exact input matches, semantic caching identifies similar requests and serves cached results, reducing redundant requests and improving response times as well as saving money.
Let‚Äôs see how to implement semantic caching with Portkey:
import time
portkey_client = Portkey(mode="single")
openai_llm = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
cache_status="semantic",
)
portkey_client.add_llms(openai_llm)
current_messages = [
ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="What are the ingredients of a pizza?"),
]
print("Testing Portkey Semantic Cache:")
start = time.time()
response = portkey_client.chat(current_messages)
end = time.time() - start
print(response)
print(f"{'-'*50}\nServed in {end} seconds.\n{'-'*50}")
new_messages = [
ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant"),
ChatMessage(role="user", content="Ingredients of pizza"),
]
print("Testing Portkey Semantic Cache:")
start = time.time()
response = portkey_client.chat(new_messages)
end = time.time() - start
print(response)
print(f"{'-'*50}\nServed in {end} seconds.\n{'-'*50}")
Portkey‚Äôs cache supports two more cache-critical functions - Force Refresh and Age.
cache_force_refresh: Force-send a request to your provider instead of serving it from a cache.
cache_age: Decide the interval at which the cache store for this particular string should get automatically refreshed. The cache age is set in seconds.
Here‚Äôs how you can use it:
# Setting the cache status as `semantic` and cache_age as 60s.
openai_llm = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
cache_force_refresh=True,
cache_age=60,
)
üî¨ Observability with Portkey#
Having insight into your application‚Äôs behavior is paramount. Portkey‚Äôs observability features allow you to monitor, debug, and optimize your AI applications with ease. You can track each request, understand its journey, and segment them based on custom tags. This level of detail can help in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing costs, and enhancing the overall user experience.
Here‚Äôs how to set up observability with Portkey:
metadata = {
"_environment": "production",
"_prompt": "test",
"_user": "user",
"_organisation": "acme",
}
trace_id = "llamaindex_portkey"
portkey_client = Portkey(mode="single")
openai_llm = pk.LLMOptions(
provider="openai",
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
virtual_key=openai_virtual_key_a,
metadata=metadata,
trace_id=trace_id,
)
portkey_client.add_llms(openai_llm)
print("Testing Observability functionality:")
response = portkey_client.chat(messages)
print(response)
üåâ Open Source AI Gateway#
Portkey‚Äôs AI Gateway uses the open source project Rubeus internally. Rubeus powers features like interoperability of LLMs, load balancing, fallbacks, and acts as an intermediary, ensuring that your requests are processed optimally.
One of the advantages of using Portkey is its flexibility. You can easily customize its behavior, redirect requests to different providers, or even bypass logging to Portkey altogether.
Here‚Äôs an example of customizing the behavior with Portkey:
portkey_client.base_url=None
üìù Feedback with Portkey#
Continuous improvement is a cornerstone of AI. To ensure your models and applications evolve and serve users better, feedback is vital. Portkey‚Äôs Feedback API offers a straightforward way to gather weighted feedback from users, allowing you to refine and improve over time.
Here‚Äôs how to utilize the Feedback API with Portkey:
Read more about Feedback here.
import requests
import json
# Endpoint URL
url = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1/feedback"
# Headers
headers = {
"x-portkey-api-key": os.environ.get("PORTKEY_API_KEY"),
"Content-Type": "application/json",
}
# Data
data = {"trace_id": "llamaindex_portkey", "value": 1}
# Making the request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
# Print the response
print(response.text)
All the feedback with
weight and
value for each trace id is available on the Portkey dashboard:
