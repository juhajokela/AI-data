[CompletionResponse(text='\nA black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. It is believed to be the result of the gravitational collapse of the remnants of an extremely massive star. The gravitational force within a black hole is incredibly strong and is due to the fact that a massive amount of matter has been squeezed into an incredibly small space. Because of this, black holes are extremely difficult to observe directly, as nothing can escape from them. Instead, scientists study the', additional_kwargs={}, raw=None, delta=None)]
