Multi-Document Agents#
In this guide, you learn towards setting up an agent that can effectively answer different types of questions over a larger set of documents.
These questions include the following
QA over a specific doc
QA comparing different docs
Summaries over a specific doc
Comparing summaries between different docs
We do this with the following architecture:
setup a “document agent” over each Document: each doc agent can do QA/summarization within its doc
setup a top-level agent over this set of document agents. Do tool retrieval and then do CoT over the set of tools to answer a question.
Setup and Download Data#
In this section, we’ll define imports and then download Wikipedia articles about different cities. Each article is stored separately.
We load in 18 cities - this is not quite at the level of “hundreds” of documents but its still large enough to warrant some top-level document retrieval!
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

Building Multi-Document Agents#
In this section we show you how to construct the multi-document agent. We first build a document agent for each document, and then define the top-level parent agent with an object index.
Build Document Agent for each Document#
In this section we define “document agents” for each document.
We define both a vector index (for semantic search) and summary index (for summarization) for each document. The two query engines are then converted into tools that are passed to an OpenAI function calling agent.
This document agent can dynamically choose to perform semantic search or summarization within a given document.
We create a separate document agent for each city.

Build Retriever-Enabled OpenAI Agent#
We build a top-level agent that can orchestrate across the different document agents to answer any user query.
This agent takes in all document agents as tools. This specific agent
RetrieverOpenAIAgent performs tool retrieval before tool use (unlike a default agent that tries to put all tools in the prompt).
Here we use a top-k retriever, but we encourage you to customize the tool retriever method!
# define tool for each document agent

Please always use the tools provided to answer a question. Do not rely on prior knowledge.\
""",
verbose=True,
)
Define Baseline Vector Store Index#
As a point of comparison, we define a “naive” RAG pipeline which dumps all docs into a single vector index collection.
We set the top_k = 4
base_index = VectorStoreIndex(all_nodes)
base_query_engine = base_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=4)
Running Example Queries#
Let’s run some example queries, ranging from QA / summaries over a single document to QA / summarization over multiple documents.
