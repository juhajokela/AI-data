Context-Augmented OpenAI Agent#
In this tutorial, we show you how to use our
ContextRetrieverOpenAIAgent implementation
to build an agent on top of OpenAI’s function API and store/index an arbitrary number of tools. Our indexing/retrieval modules help to remove the complexity of having too many functions to fit in the prompt.
Initial Setup#
Here we setup a ContextRetrieverOpenAIAgent. This agent will perform retrieval first before calling any tools. This can help ground the agent’s tool picking and answering capabilities in context.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

Try Context-Augmented Agent#
Here we augment our agent with context in different settings:
toy context: we define some abbreviations that map to financial terms (e.g. R=Revenue). We supply this as context to the agent
from llama_index.core import Document
from llama_index.agent.openai_legacy import ContextRetrieverOpenAIAgent
# toy index - stores a list of abbreviations
texts = [
"Abbreviation: X = Revenue",
"Abbreviation: YZ = Risk Factors",
"Abbreviation: Z = Costs",
]
docs = [Document(text=t) for t in texts]
context_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
context_agent = ContextRetrieverOpenAIAgent.from_tools_and_retriever(
query_engine_tools,
context_index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=1),

Revenue
Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,

Revenue $ 4,845 $ 8,343 72 %$ 11,677 $ 23,270 99 %
Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with the Same Period in 2021
Revenue increased $3.5 billion, or 72%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 26%, or 32% on a constant currency basis. The increase in
Gross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $1.3 billion increase in
Freight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2022, we saw a
$1.1 billion increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK. We also saw a $164 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from
an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where
we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with the Same Period in 2021
Revenue increased $11.6 billion, or 99%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 31%, or 36% on a constant currency basis. The increase in
Gross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $4.4 billion increase in
Freight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2022, we
saw a $2.2 billion net increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK and an accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in
the UK relating to the classification of drivers. We also saw a $751 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and
incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where we are primarily responsible for

Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these
arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver
incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.
During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility
services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the
transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for
mobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in
exchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
For additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,” “Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue
Recognition,” and “Note 2 - Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2021 and Note 2 – Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization
Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit
card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation
services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are
primarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.
We expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip
volume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located
data center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
Operations and Support
Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in
cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer
support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.
As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an
absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising
costs, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of
certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.
As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for
