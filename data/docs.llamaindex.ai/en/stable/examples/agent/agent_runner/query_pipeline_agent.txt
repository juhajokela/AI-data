Building an Agent around a Query Pipeline#
In this cookbook we show you how to build an agent around a query pipeline.
Agents offer the ability to do complex, sequential reasoning on top of any query DAG that you have setup. Conceptually this is also one of the ways you can add a “loop” to the graph.
We show you two examples of agents you can implement:
a full ReAct agent that can do tool picking
a “simple” agent that adds a retry layer around a text-to-sql query engine.
from llama_index.core import SQLDatabase
from sqlalchemy import (
create_engine,
MetaData,
Table,
Column,
String,
Integer,
select,
column,
)
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///chinook.db")
sql_database = SQLDatabase(engine)
from llama_index.core.query_pipeline import QueryPipeline

Setup Observability#
We setup Arize Phoenix for observability.
# define global callback setting
from llama_index.core.settings import Settings
from llama_index.core.callbacks import CallbackManager
callback_manager = CallbackManager()
Settings.callback_manager = callback_manager
# setup Arize Phoenix for logging/observability
import phoenix as px
import llama_index.core
px.launch_app()
llama_index.core.set_global_handler("arize_phoenix")
Setup Text-to-SQL Query Engine / Tool#
Now we setup a simple text-to-SQL tool: given a query, translate text to SQL, execute against database, and get back a result.
from llama_index.core.query_engine import NLSQLTableQueryEngine
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool
sql_query_engine = NLSQLTableQueryEngine(
sql_database=sql_database,
tables=["albums", "tracks", "artists"],
verbose=True,
)
sql_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
query_engine=sql_query_engine,
name="sql_tool",
description=(
"Useful for translating a natural language query into a SQL query"
),
)
Setup ReAct Agent Pipeline#
We now setup a ReAct pipeline for a single step using our Query Pipeline syntax. This is a multi-part process that does the following:
Takes in agent inputs
Calls ReAct prompt using LLM to generate next action/tool (or returns a response).
If tool/action is selected, call tool pipeline to execute tool + collect response.
If response is generated, get response.
Throughout this we’ll use a variety of agent-specific query components. Unlike normal query pipelines, these are specifically designed for query pipelines that are used in a
QueryPipelineAgentWorker:
An
AgentInputComponentthat allows you to convert the agent inputs (Task, state dictionary) into a set of inputs for the query pipeline.
An
AgentFnComponent: a general processor that allows you to take in the current Task, state, as well as any arbitrary inputs, and returns an output. In this cookbook we define a function component to format the ReAct prompt. However, you can put this anywhere.
[Not used in this notebook] An
CustomAgentComponent: similar to
AgentFnComponent, you can implement
_run_componentto define your own logic, with access to Task and state. It is more verbose but more flexible than
AgentFnComponent(e.g. you can define init variables, and callbacks are in the base class).
Note that any function passed into
AgentFnComponent and
AgentInputComponent MUST include
task and
state as input variables, as these are inputs passed from the agent.
Note that the output of an agentic query pipeline MUST be
Tuple[AgentChatResponse, bool]. You’ll see this below.
from llama_index.core.query_pipeline import QueryPipeline as QP
qp = QP(verbose=True)
Define Agent Input Component#
Here we define the agent input component, called at the beginning of every agent step. Besides passing along the input, we also do initialization/state modification.
from llama_index.core.agent.react.types import (
ActionReasoningStep,
ObservationReasoningStep,
ResponseReasoningStep,
)
from llama_index.core.agent import Task, AgentChatResponse
from llama_index.core.query_pipeline import (
AgentInputComponent,
AgentFnComponent,
CustomAgentComponent,
QueryComponent,
ToolRunnerComponent,
)
from llama_index.core.llms import MessageRole
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, Tuple, List, cast
## Agent Input Component
## This is the component that produces agent inputs to the rest of the components
## Can also put initialization logic here.
def agent_input_fn(task: Task, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
"""Agent input function.
Returns:
A Dictionary of output keys and values. If you are specifying
src_key when defining links between this component and other
components, make sure the src_key matches the specified output_key.
"""
# initialize current_reasoning
if "current_reasoning" not in state:
state["current_reasoning"] = []
reasoning_step = ObservationReasoningStep(observation=task.input)
state["current_reasoning"].append(reasoning_step)
return {"input": task.input}
agent_input_component = AgentInputComponent(fn=agent_input_fn)
Define Agent Prompt#
Here we define the agent component that generates a ReAct prompt, and after the output is generated from the LLM, parses into a structured object.
from llama_index.core.agent import ReActChatFormatter
from llama_index.core.query_pipeline import InputComponent, Link
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.core.tools import BaseTool
## define prompt function
def react_prompt_fn(
task: Task, state: Dict[str, Any], input: str, tools: List[BaseTool]
) -> List[ChatMessage]:
# Add input to reasoning
chat_formatter = ReActChatFormatter()
return chat_formatter.format(
tools,
chat_history=task.memory.get() + state["memory"].get_all(),
current_reasoning=state["current_reasoning"],
)
react_prompt_component = AgentFnComponent(
fn=react_prompt_fn, partial_dict={"tools": [sql_tool]}
)
Define Agent Output Parser + Tool Pipeline#
Once the LLM gives an output, we have a decision tree:
If an answer is given, then we’re done. Process the output
If an action is given, we need to execute the specified tool with the specified args, and then process the output.
Tool calling can be done via the
ToolRunnerComponent module. This is a simple wrapper module that takes in a list of tools, and can be “executed” with the specified tool name (every tool has a name) and tool action.
We implement this overall module
OutputAgentComponent that subclasses
CustomAgentComponent.
Note: we also implement
sub_query_components to pass through higher-level callback managers to the tool runner submodule.
from typing import Set, Optional
from llama_index.core.agent.react.output_parser import ReActOutputParser
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatResponse
from llama_index.core.agent.types import Task
def parse_react_output_fn(
task: Task, state: Dict[str, Any], chat_response: ChatResponse
):
"""Parse ReAct output into a reasoning step."""
output_parser = ReActOutputParser()
reasoning_step = output_parser.parse(chat_response.message.content)
return {"done": reasoning_step.is_done, "reasoning_step": reasoning_step}
parse_react_output = AgentFnComponent(fn=parse_react_output_fn)
def run_tool_fn(
task: Task, state: Dict[str, Any], reasoning_step: ActionReasoningStep
):
"""Run tool and process tool output."""
tool_runner_component = ToolRunnerComponent(
[sql_tool], callback_manager=task.callback_manager
)
tool_output = tool_runner_component.run_component(
tool_name=reasoning_step.action,
tool_input=reasoning_step.action_input,
)
observation_step = ObservationReasoningStep(observation=str(tool_output))
state["current_reasoning"].append(observation_step)
# TODO: get output
return {"response_str": observation_step.get_content(), "is_done": False}

task: Task, state: Dict[str, Any], response_step: ResponseReasoningStep
):
"""Process response."""
state["current_reasoning"].append(response_step)
response_str = response_step.response
# Now that we're done with this step, put into memory
state["memory"].put(ChatMessage(content=task.input, role=MessageRole.USER))
state["memory"].put(
ChatMessage(content=response_str, role=MessageRole.ASSISTANT)
)
return {"response_str": response_str, "is_done": True}
process_response = AgentFnComponent(fn=process_response_fn)
def process_agent_response_fn(
task: Task, state: Dict[str, Any], response_dict: dict
):
"""Process agent response."""
return (
AgentChatResponse(response_dict["response_str"]),
response_dict["is_done"],
)
process_agent_response = AgentFnComponent(fn=process_agent_response_fn)
Stitch together Agent Query Pipeline#
We can now stitch together the top-level agent pipeline: agent_input -> react_prompt -> llm -> react_output.
The last component is the if-else component that calls sub-components.

)
# link input to react prompt to parsed out response (either tool action/input or observation)
qp.add_chain(["agent_input", "react_prompt", "llm", "react_output_parser"])
# add conditional link from react output to tool call (if not done)
qp.add_link(
"react_output_parser",

Setup Simple Retry Agent Pipeline for Text-to-SQL#
Instead of the full ReAct pipeline that does tool picking, let’s try a much simpler agent pipeline that only does text-to-SQL, with retry-logic.
We try a simple text-based “retry” prompt where given the user input and previous conversation history, can generate a modified query that outputs the right result.
