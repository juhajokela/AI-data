Controllable Agents for RAG#
Adding agentic capabilities on top of your RAG pipeline can allow you to reason over much more complex questions.
But a big pain point for agents is the lack of steerability/transparency. An agent may tackle a user query through chain-of-thought/planning, which requires repeated calls to an LLM. During this process it can be hard to inspect what’s going on, or stop/correct execution in the middle.
This notebook shows you how to use our brand-new lower-level agent API, which allows controllable step-wise execution, on top of a RAG pipeline.
We showcase this over Wikipedia documents.

response = agent.chat("Analyze the changes in R&D expenditures and revenue")
Thought: To analyze the changes in R&D expenditures and revenue, I can use the quarterly financial data provided by the tools.
Action: march_2022
Action Input: {'input': 'R&D expenditures'}
Observation: Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31 increased from $515 million in 2021 to $587 million in 2022, which is a 14% change. The increase was primarily attributable to a $63 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The percentage of revenue allocated to research and development decreased from 18% in 2021 to 9% in 2022.
Thought: I have obtained the information about the changes in R&D expenditures for the quarter ending March 2022. Now, I need to gather information about the revenue for the same period to analyze the changes.
Action: march_2022
Action Input: {'input': 'revenue'}
Observation: Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022, was $6,854 million, which represents a 136% increase from the $2,903 million reported in the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to a 35% increase in Gross Bookings, driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, and a $1.5 billion increase in Freight revenue resulting from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, there was a $304 million increase in Delivery revenue and a $200 million increase in Mobility revenue due to business model changes in the UK.
Thought: I have obtained the information about the changes in R&D expenditures and revenue for the quarter ending March 2022. Now, I can analyze the changes.

On the other hand, the revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022, was $6,854 million, representing a 136% increase from the $2,903 million reported in the same period in 2021. This significant increase in revenue was primarily driven by a 35% increase in Gross Bookings, driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, there was a $1.5 billion increase in Freight revenue resulting from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Furthermore, there was a $304 million increase in Delivery revenue and a $200 million increase in Mobility revenue due to business model changes in the UK.
Overall, while R&D expenditures increased, the revenue experienced a substantial growth, indicating positive financial performance for Uber in the first quarter of 2022.

Observation: Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022, were $704 million, which is a 44% increase from $488 million in the same period in 2021. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, research and development expenses were $1,291 million, up 29% from $1,003 million in the same period in 2021. The increase in expenses for both periods was primarily due to a rise in stock-based compensation and an increase in employee headcount costs.

Added user message to memory: What are the risk factors in the last two quarters?
Thought: I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.
Action: march_2022
Action Input: {'input': 'risk factors'}
Observation: The risk factors affecting the business include:
- Significant reliance on Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, which may be negatively affected by various conditions including economic, social, weather, regulatory conditions, and circumstances like COVID-19.
- Potential failure to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on the platform, or offering technologies that may be inferior or perceived as less safe compared to competitors.
- Dependence on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, with the risk that attrition or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect the business.
- Risks of security or data privacy breaches, unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of proprietary, confidential, employee, or platform user data.
- Threats from cyberattacks, such as malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks, which could harm reputation, business, and operating results.
- Climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, that could adversely impact the business if not managed effectively.
- Commitments related to climate change that require significant investment and management time, with the potential need to revise timeframes for implementing these commitments due to circumstances beyond control.
- Reliance on third parties for distribution of products and offerings and for providing software used in certain products, with the risk that interference could adversely affect the business.
- The need for additional capital to support business growth, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- Risks associated with identifying, acquiring, and integrating suitable businesses, and the performance and integration of acquired businesses.
- The possibility of being blocked from or limited in providing or operating products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, potentially requiring modifications to the business model.
- Numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on the business and future prospects.
- Extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- Risks related to the collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in legal actions and negative publicity.
- The need to protect intellectual property and the risk of incurring significant expenses if third parties claim misappropriation of their intellectual property.
- Volatility in the market price of common stock, which may not align with operating performance, potentially leading to the inability to resell shares at or above the purchase price.
- The COVID-19 pandemic's adverse impact on business, financial condition, and results of operations, with the potential for continued adverse effects.
- Adverse effects on the business if Drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors.
- Highly competitive mobility, delivery, and logistics industries with low barriers to entry and well-capitalized competitors.
- The possibility of lowering fares or service fees and offering Driver incentives and consumer discounts to remain competitive.
- A history of significant losses and the expectation of increased operating expenses without guaranteed profitability.
- The necessity of attracting or maintaining a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to keep the platform appealing.
- The importance of maintaining and enhancing brand and reputation, with the risk that failure to do so will harm the business.
- Challenges related to historical workplace culture and the need for successful efforts to address these challenges.
- The risk of not effectively managing growth or optimizing organizational structure, which could adversely affect financial performance and future prospects.
- The potential for major safety incidents due to criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity by platform users, impacting the ability to attract and retain users.
- Substantial investments in new offerings and technologies that are inherently risky and may not yield expected benefits.
- Dependence on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under the company's control, with the risk of disruptions affecting the platform's availability and efficiency.
