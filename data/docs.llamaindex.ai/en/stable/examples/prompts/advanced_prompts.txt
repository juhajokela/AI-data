Advanced Prompt Techniques (Variable Mappings, Functions)#
In this notebook we show some advanced prompt techniques. These features allow you to define more custom/expressive prompts, re-use existing ones, and also express certain operations in fewer lines of code.
We show the following features:
Partial formatting
Prompt template variable mappings
Prompt function mappings

1. Partial Formatting#
Partial formatting (
partial_format) allows you to partially format a prompt, filling in some variables while leaving others to be filled in later.
This is a nice convenience function so you don’t have to maintain all the required prompt variables all the way down to
format, you can partially format as they come in.
This will create a copy of the prompt template.

Answer:
2. Prompt Template Variable Mappings#
Template var mappings allow you to specify a mapping from the “expected” prompt keys (e.g.
context_str and
query_str for response synthesis), with the keys actually in your template.
This allows you re-use your existing string templates without having to annoyingly change out the template variables.
# NOTE: here notice we use `my_context` and `my_query` as template variables

3. Prompt Function Mappings#
You can also pass in functions as template variables instead of fixed values.
This allows you to dynamically inject certain values, dependent on other values, during query-time.
Here are some basic examples. We show more advanced examples (e.g. few-shot examples) in our Prompt Engineering for RAG guide.
