Accessing/Customizing Prompts within Higher-Level Modules#
LlamaIndex contains a variety of higher-level modules (query engines, response synthesizers, retrievers, etc.), many of which make LLM calls + use prompt templates.
This guide shows how you can 1) access the set of prompts for any module (including nested) with
get_prompts, and 2) update these prompts easily with
update_prompts.
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
!pip install llama-index

import openai
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

import sys
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))

Setup: Load Data, Build Index, and Get Query Engine#
Here we build a vector index over a toy dataset (PGâ€™s essay), and access the query engine.
The query engine is a simple RAG pipeline consisting of top-k retrieval + LLM synthesis.
Download Data
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'
!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'
# load documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
# set Logging to DEBUG for more detailed outputs
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="tree_summarize")
# define prompt viewing function
def display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict):
for k, p in prompts_dict.items():
text_md = f"**Prompt Key**: {k}<br>" f"**Text:** <br>"
display(Markdown(text_md))
print(p.get_template())
display(Markdown("<br><br>"))
Accessing Prompts#
Here we get the prompts from the query engine. Note that all prompts are returned, including ones used in sub-modules in the query engine. This allows you to centralize a view of these prompts!
prompts_dict = query_engine.get_prompts()
display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)
Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:summary_template
Text:

Answer:
Checking
get_prompts on Response Synthesizer#
You can also call
get_prompts on the underlying response synthesizer, where youâ€™ll see the same list.
prompts_dict = query_engine.response_synthesizer.get_prompts()
display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)
Prompt Key: summary_template
Text:

Answer:
Checking
get_prompts with a different response synthesis strategy#
Here we try the default
compact method.
Weâ€™ll see that the set of templates used are different; a QA template and a refine template.
# set Logging to DEBUG for more detailed outputs
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="compact")
prompts_dict = query_engine.get_prompts()
display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: {query_str}
Answer:
Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:refine_template
Text:
The original query is as follows: {query_str}
We have provided an existing answer: {existing_answer}
We have the opportunity to refine the existing answer (only if needed) with some more context below.
------------
{context_msg}
------------
Given the new context, refine the original answer to better answer the query. If the context isn't useful, return the original answer.
Refined Answer:
Put into query engine, get response#
response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")
print(str(response))
The author worked on writing and programming outside of school before college. They wrote short stories and tried writing programs on an IBM 1401 computer using an early version of Fortran. They later got a microcomputer and started programming on it, writing simple games and a word processor. They also mentioned their interest in philosophy and AI.
Customize the prompt#
You can also update/customize the prompts with the
update_prompts function. Pass in arg values with the keys equal to the keys you see in the prompt dictionary.
Here weâ€™ll change the summary prompt to use Shakespeare.
from llama_index.core import PromptTemplate
# reset
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="tree_summarize")
# shakespeare!
new_summary_tmpl_str = (
"Context information is below.\n"
"---------------------\n"
"{context_str}\n"
"---------------------\n"
"Given the context information and not prior knowledge, "
"answer the query in the style of a Shakespeare play.\n"
"Query: {query_str}\n"
"Answer: "
)
new_summary_tmpl = PromptTemplate(new_summary_tmpl_str)
query_engine.update_prompts(
{"response_synthesizer:summary_template": new_summary_tmpl}
)
prompts_dict = query_engine.get_prompts()
display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)
Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:summary_template

print(str(response))
Accessing Prompts from Other Modules#
Here we take a look at some other modules: query engines, routers/selectors, evaluators, and others.
from llama_index.core.query_engine import (
RouterQueryEngine,
FLAREInstructQueryEngine,
)
from llama_index.core.selectors import LLMMultiSelector
from llama_index.core.evaluation import FaithfulnessEvaluator, DatasetGenerator
from llama_index.core.postprocessor import LLMRerank
Analyze Prompts: Router Query Engine#
# setup sample router query engine
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool
query_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
query_engine=query_engine, description="test description"
)
router_query_engine = RouterQueryEngine.from_defaults([query_tool])
prompts_dict = router_query_engine.get_prompts()
display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)

Skill 1. Use the Search API to look up relevant information by writing "[Search(query)]" where "query" is the search query you want to look up. For example:
Query: But what are the risks during production of nanomaterials?
Answer: [Search(What are some nanomaterial production risks?)]
Query: The colors on the flag of Ghana have the following meanings.
Answer: Red is for [Search(What is the meaning of Ghana's flag being red?)], green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth.
Query: What did the author do during his time in college?
Answer: The author took classes in [Search(What classes did the author take in college?)].
Skill 2. Solve more complex generation tasks by thinking step by step. For example:
Query: Give a summary of the author's life and career.
Answer: The author was born in 1990. Growing up, he [Search(What did the author do during his childhood?)].
Query: Can you write a summary of the Great Gatsby.
Answer: The Great Gatsby is a novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is about [Search(What is the Great Gatsby about?)].
Now given the following task, and the stub of an existing answer, generate the next portion of the answer. You may use the Search API "[Search(query)]" whenever possible.
If the answer is complete and no longer contains any "[Search(query)]" tags, write "done" to finish the task.
Do not write "done" if the answer still contains "[Search(query)]" tags.
Do not make up answers. It is better to generate one "[Search(query)]" tag and stop generation
than to fill in the answer with made up information with no "[Search(query)]" tags
or multiple "[Search(query)]" tags that assume a structure in the answer.
Try to limit generation to one sentence if possible.

Answer:
Prompt Key: lookahead_answer_inserter:answer_insert_prompt
Text:
An existing 'lookahead response' is given below. The lookahead response
contains `[Search(query)]` tags. Some queries have been executed and the
response retrieved. The queries and answers are also given below.
Also the previous response (the response before the lookahead response)
is given below.
Given the lookahead template, previous response, and also queries and answers,
please 'fill in' the lookahead template with the appropriate answers.
NOTE: Please make sure that the final response grammatically follows
the previous response + lookahead template. For example, if the previous
response is "New York City has a population of " and the lookahead
template is "[Search(What is the population of New York City?)]", then
the final response should be "8.4 million".
NOTE: the lookahead template may not be a complete sentence and may
contain trailing/leading commas, etc. Please preserve the original
formatting of the lookahead template if possible.
NOTE:
NOTE: the exception to the above rule is if the answer to a query
is equivalent to "I don't know" or "I don't have an answer". In this case,
modify the lookahead template to indicate that the answer is not known.
NOTE: the lookahead template may contain multiple `[Search(query)]` tags
and only a subset of these queries have been executed.
Do not replace the `[Search(query)]` tags that have not been executed.
Previous Response:
Lookahead Template:
Red is for [Search(What is the meaning of Ghana's flag being red?)], green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth.
