Comparing Methods for Structured Retrieval (Auto-Retrieval vs. Recursive Retrieval)#
In a naive RAG system, the set of input documents are then chunked, embedded, and dumped to a vector database collection. Retrieval would just fetch the top-k documents by embedding similarity.
This can fail if the set of documents is large - it can be hard to disambiguate raw chunks, and you‚Äôre not guaranteed to filter for the set of documents that contain relevant context.
In this guide we explore structured retrieval - more advanced query algorithms that take advantage of structure within your documents for higher-precision retrieval. We compare the following two methods:
Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval: Tag each document with the right set of metadata. During query-time, use auto-retrieval to infer metadata filters along with passing through the query string for semantic search.
Store Document Hierarchies (summaries -> raw chunks) + Recursive Retrieval: Embed document summaries and map that to the set of raw chunks for each document. During query-time, do recursive retrieval to first fetch summaries before fetching documents.
If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.

Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval#
In this approach, we tag each Document with metadata (category, country), and store in a Weaviate vector db.
During retrieval-time, we then perform ‚Äúauto-retrieval‚Äù to infer the relevant set of metadata filters.

In December 2023, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again for the SEC.
== Public perception ==
Though his ventures were influential within their own industries in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his "part philosopher, part troll" role on Twitter.Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008). Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2. Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013), Why Him? (2016), and Men in Black: International (2019). Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons ("The Musk Who Fell to Earth", 2015), The Big Bang Theory ("The Platonic Permutation", 2015), South Park ("Members Only", 2016), Young Sheldon ("A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac¬Æ", 2017), Rick and Morty ("One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty", 2019), and Saturday Night Live (2021).

He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University and IEEE Honorary Membership.

In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.
== Media figure and business interests ==
=== Endorsements ===
Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "Be Like Mike" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon.

After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father. Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father. He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.In one incident, after having called a boy whose father had committed suicide "stupid", Musk was severely beaten and thrown down concrete steps. His father derided Elon for his behavior and showed no sympathy for him despite his injuries. He was also an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, Lord of the Flies, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual. At age twelve, Musk sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.
=== Education ===
Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.
