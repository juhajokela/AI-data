Llama Pack - Resume Screener ðŸ“„#
This example shows you how to use the Resume Screener Llama Pack. You can find all packs on https://llamahub.ai
The resume screener is designed to analyze a candidateâ€™s resume according to a set of criteria, and decide whether the candidate is a fit for the job.
in this example weâ€™ll evaluate a sample resume (e.g. Jerryâ€™s old resume).
%pip install llama-index-readers-wikipedia
!pip install llama-index llama-hub
Setup Data#
Weâ€™ll load some sample Wikipedia data for OpenAI, Sam, Mira, and Emmett. Why? No reason in particular :)
from llama_index.readers.wikipedia import WikipediaReader
loader = WikipediaReader()
documents = loader.load_data(
pages=["OpenAI", "Sam Altman", "Mira Murati", "Emmett Shear"],
auto_suggest=False,
)
# do sentence splitting on the first piece of text
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
sentence_splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=1024)
We get the first chunk from each essay.
# get the first 1024 tokens for each entity
openai_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[0]])[0]
sama_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[1]])[0]
mira_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[2]])[0]
emmett_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[3]])[0]
Weâ€™ll also download Jerryâ€™s resume in 2019.
Download Resume Screener Pack from LlamaHub#
Here we download the resume screener pack class from LlamaHub.
Weâ€™ll use it for two use cases:
whether the candidate is a good fit for a front-end / full-stack engineering role.
whether the candidate is a good fit for the CEO of OpenAI.
