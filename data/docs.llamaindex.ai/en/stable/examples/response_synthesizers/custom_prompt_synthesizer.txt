Pydantic Tree Summarize#
In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use tree summarize with structured outputs. Specifically, tree summarize is used to output pydantic objects.
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
!pip install llama-index
import os
import openai
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
Download Data#
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'
!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'
Load Data#
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader
reader = SimpleDirectoryReader(
input_files=["./data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt"]
)
docs = reader.load_data()
text = docs[0].text
Define Custom Prompt#
from llama_index.core import PromptTemplate
# NOTE: we add an extra tone_name variable here
qa_prompt_tmpl = (
"Context information is below.\n"
"---------------------\n"
"{context_str}\n"
"---------------------\n"
"Given the context information and not prior knowledge, "
"answer the query.\n"
"Please also write the answer in the style of {tone_name}.\n"
"Query: {query_str}\n"
"Answer: "
)
qa_prompt = PromptTemplate(qa_prompt_tmpl)
refine_prompt_tmpl = (
"The original query is as follows: {query_str}\n"
"We have provided an existing answer: {existing_answer}\n"
"We have the opportunity to refine the existing answer "
"(only if needed) with some more context below.\n"
"------------\n"
"{context_msg}\n"
"------------\n"
"Given the new context, refine the original answer to better "
"answer the query. "
"Please also write the answer in the style of {tone_name}.\n"
"If the context isn't useful, return the original answer.\n"
"Refined Answer: "
)
refine_prompt = PromptTemplate(refine_prompt_tmpl)
Try out Response Synthesis with Custom Prompt#
We try out a few different response synthesis strategies with the custom prompt.

Paul Graham, a noble and esteemed gentleman, is a man of many talents and accomplishments. He hath traversed the realms of art, entrepreneurship, and writing, leaving a lasting impact on each. With his brush, he hath brought life to canvases, capturing the essence of what he saw.

His wisdom and guidance hath shaped the future of technology and entrepreneurship through his co-founding of Y Combinator. But above all, Paul Graham is a visionary, a trailblazer, and a true Renaissance man, whose intellectual curiosity and quest for lasting creation hath inspired generations to come.
