QuestionGeneration#
This notebook walks through the process of generating a list of questions that could be asked about your data. This is useful for setting up an evaluation pipeline using the
FaithfulnessEvaluator and
RelevancyEvaluator evaluation tools.
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
