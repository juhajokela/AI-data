Knowledge Graph RAG Query Engine#
Graph RAG#
Graph RAG is an Knowledge-enabled RAG approach to retrieve information from Knowledge Graph on given task. Typically, this is to build context based on entities‚Äô SubGraph related to the task.
GraphStore backed RAG vs VectorStore RAG#
As we compared how Graph RAG helps in some use cases in this tutorial, it‚Äôs shown Knowledge Graph as the unique format of information could mitigate several issues caused by the nature of the ‚Äúsplit and embedding‚Äù RAG approach.
Why Knowledge Graph RAG Query Engine#
In Llama Index, there are two scenarios we could apply Graph RAG:
Build Knowledge Graph from documents with Llama Index, with LLM or even local models, to do this, we should go for
KnowledgeGraphIndex.
Leveraging existing Knowledge Graph, in this case, we should use
KnowledgeGraphRAGQueryEngine.
Note, the third query engine that‚Äôs related to KG in Llama Index is
NL2GraphQueryor
Text2Cypher, for either exiting KG or not, it could be done with
KnowledgeGraphQueryEngine.
Before we start the
Knowledge Graph RAG QueryEngine demo, let‚Äôs first get ready for basic preparation of Llama Index.
If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.

Prepare for NebulaGraph#
We take NebulaGraphStore as an example in this demo, thus before next step to perform Graph RAG on existing KG, let‚Äôs ensure we have a running NebulaGraph with defined data schema.
This step installs the clients of NebulaGraph, and prepare contexts that defines a NebulaGraph Graph Space.
# Create a NebulaGraph (version 3.5.0 or newer) cluster with:
# Option 0 for machines with Docker: `curl -fsSL nebula-up.siwei.io/install.sh | bash`
# Option 1 for Desktop: NebulaGraph Docker Extension https://hub.docker.com/extensions/weygu/nebulagraph-dd-ext
# If not, create it with the following commands from NebulaGraph's console:
# CREATE SPACE llamaindex(vid_type=FIXED_STRING(256), partition_num=1, replica_factor=1);
# :sleep 10;
# USE llamaindex;
# CREATE TAG entity(name string);
# CREATE EDGE relationship(relationship string);
# :sleep 10;
# CREATE TAG INDEX entity_index ON entity(name(256));
%pip install ipython-ngql nebula3-python
os.environ["NEBULA_USER"] = "root"
os.environ["NEBULA_PASSWORD"] = "nebula" # default is "nebula"
os.environ[
"NEBULA_ADDRESS"
] = "127.0.0.1:9669" # assumed we have NebulaGraph installed locally
space_name = "llamaindex"
edge_types, rel_prop_names = ["relationship"], [

Then we could instiatate a
NebulaGraphStore, in order to create a
StorageContext‚Äôs
graph_store as it.
from llama_index.core import StorageContext
from llama_index.graph_stores.nebula import NebulaGraphStore
graph_store = NebulaGraphStore(
space_name=space_name,
edge_types=edge_types,
rel_prop_names=rel_prop_names,
tags=tags,
)
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(graph_store=graph_store)
Here, we assumed to have the same Knowledge Graph from this turtorial
Perform Graph RAG Query#
Finally, let‚Äôs demo how to do Graph RAG towards an existing Knowledge Graph.
All we need to do is to use
RetrieverQueryEngine and configure the retriver of it to be
KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever.
The
KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever performs the following steps:
Search related Entities of the quesion/task
Get SubGraph of those Entities (default 2-depth) from the KG
Build Context based on the SubGraph
Please note, the way to Search related Entities could be either Keyword extraction based or Embedding based, which is controlled by argument
retriever_mode of the
KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever, and supported options are:
‚Äúkeyword‚Äù
‚Äúembedding‚Äù(not yet implemented)
‚Äúkeyword_embedding‚Äù(not yet implemented)
Here is the example on how to use
RetrieverQueryEngine and
KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever:
from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine
from llama_index.core.retrievers import KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever
graph_rag_retriever = KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever(
storage_context=storage_context,
verbose=True,
)
query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(
graph_rag_retriever,
)
Then we can query it like:
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
response = query_engine.query(
"Tell me about Peter Quill?",
)
display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))
Entities processed: ['Star', 'Lord', 'Marvel', 'Quill', 'Galaxy', 'Guardians', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Star-Lord', 'Peter Quill', 'Peter']

Include nl2graphquery as Context in Graph RAG#
The nature of (Sub)Graph RAG and nl2graphquery are different. No one is better than the other but just when one fits more in certain type of questions. To understand more on how they differ from the other, see this demo comparing the two.
While in real world cases, we may not always know which approach works better, thus, one way to best leverage KG in RAG are fetching both retrieval results as context and letting LLM + Prompt generate answer with them all being involved.
So, optionally, we could choose to synthesise answer from two piece of retrieved context from KG:
Graph RAG, the default retrieval method, which extracts subgraph that‚Äôs related to the key entities in the question.
NL2GraphQuery, generate Knowledge Graph Query based on query and the Schema of the Knowledge Graph, which is by default switched off.
We could set
with_nl2graphquery=True to enable it like:
graph_rag_retriever_with_nl2graphquery = KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever(
storage_context=storage_context,
verbose=True,
with_nl2graphquery=True,
)
query_engine_with_nl2graphquery = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(
graph_rag_retriever_with_nl2graphquery,
)
response = query_engine_with_nl2graphquery.query(
"What do you know about Peter Quill?",
)
display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))
Graph Store Query:
```
MATCH (p:`entity`)-[:`relationship`]->(m:`entity`) WHERE p.`entity`.`name` == 'Peter Quill'
RETURN m.`entity`.`name`;
```
Graph Store Response:
{'m.entity.name': ['May 2021', 'as a child', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'a group of alien thieves and smugglers', 'half-Celestial']}
Entities processed: ['Star', 'Lord', 'Marvel', 'Quill', 'Galaxy', 'Guardians', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Star-Lord', 'Peter Quill', 'Peter']

And let‚Äôs check the response‚Äôs metadata to know more details of the retrival of Graph RAG with nl2graphquery by inspecting
response.metadata.
text2Cypher, it generates a Cypher Query towards the answer as the context.
Graph Store Query: MATCH (e:`entity`)-[r:`relationship`]->(e2:`entity`)
WHERE e.`entity`.`name` == 'Peter Quill'
RETURN e2.`entity`.`name`
SubGraph RAG, it get the SubGraph of ‚ÄòPeter Quill‚Äô to build the context.
Finally, it combined the two nodes of context, to synthesize the answer.
