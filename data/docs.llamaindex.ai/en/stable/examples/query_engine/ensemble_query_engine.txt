Ensemble Query Engine Guide#
Oftentimes when building a RAG application there are different query pipelines you need to experiment with (e.g. top-k retrieval, keyword search, knowledge graphs).
Thought: what if we could try a bunch of strategies at once, and have the LLM 1) rate the relevance of each query, and 2) synthesize the results?
This guide showcases this over the Great Gatsby. We do ensemble retrieval over different chunk sizes and also different indices.
NOTE: Please also see our closely-related Ensemble Retrieval Guide!
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
%pip install llama-index-llms-openai
!pip install llama-index
Setup#
# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.
# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.
# This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.
# This is normally not allowed, we use nest_asyncio to allow it for convenience.
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes, and insert into a DocumentStore.

)
print(response)
Gatsby and Daisy's interactions are described as intimate and conspiring. They sit opposite each other at a kitchen table, with Gatsby's hand covering Daisy's hand. They communicate through nods and seem to have a natural intimacy. Gatsby waits for Daisy to go to bed and is reluctant to leave until he knows what she will do. They have a conversation in which Gatsby tells the story of his youth with Dan Cody. Daisy's face is smeared with tears, but Gatsby glows with a new well-being. Gatsby invites Daisy to his house and expresses his desire for her to come. They admire Gatsby's house together and discuss the interesting people who visit. The relevance score of this answer is 10/10.
response = keyword_query_engine.query(
"Describe and summarize the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy"
)
> Starting query: Describe and summarize the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy
query keywords: ['describe', 'interactions', 'gatsby', 'summarize', 'daisy']
> Extracted keywords: ['gatsby', 'daisy']
print(response)
The interactions between Gatsby and Daisy are characterized by a sense of tension and longing. Gatsby is visibly disappointed when Daisy expresses her dissatisfaction with their time together and insists that she didn't have a good time. He feels distant from her and struggles to make her understand his emotions. Gatsby dismisses the significance of the dance and instead focuses on his desire for Daisy to confess her love for him and leave Tom. He yearns for a deep connection with Daisy, but feels that she doesn't fully comprehend his feelings. These interactions highlight the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they face in rekindling their romance. The relevance score for these interactions is 8 out of 10.
