SQL Join Query Engine#
In this tutorial, we show you how to use our SQLJoinQueryEngine.
This query engine allows you to combine insights from your structured tables with your unstructured data. It first decides whether to query your structured tables for insights. Once it does, it can then infer a corresponding query to the vector store in order to fetch corresponding documents.
Setup#
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
%pip install llama-index-readers-wikipedia
%pip install llama-index-llms-openai
!pip install llama-index
# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.
# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.
# This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.
# This is normally not allowed, we use nest_asyncio to allow it for convenience.
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
import logging
import sys
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))
Create Common Objects#
This includes a
ServiceContext object containing abstractions such as the LLM and chunk size.
This also includes a
StorageContext object containing our vector store abstractions.
# # define pinecone index
# import pinecone
# import os
# api_key = os.environ['PINECONE_API_KEY']
# pinecone.init(api_key=api_key, environment="us-west1-gcp")
# # dimensions are for text-embedding-ada-002
# # pinecone.create_index("quickstart", dimension=1536, metric="euclidean", pod_type="p1")
# pinecone_index = pinecone.Index("quickstart")
# # OPTIONAL: delete all
# pinecone_index.delete(deleteAll=True)
Create Database Schema + Test Data#
Here we introduce a toy scenario where there are 100 tables (too big to fit into the prompt)
from sqlalchemy import (
create_engine,
MetaData,
Table,
Column,
String,
Integer,
select,
column,
)
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:", future=True)
metadata_obj = MetaData()
# create city SQL table
table_name = "city_stats"
city_stats_table = Table(
table_name,
metadata_obj,
Column("city_name", String(16), primary_key=True),
Column("population", Integer),
Column("country", String(16), nullable=False),
)
metadata_obj.create_all(engine)
# print tables
metadata_obj.tables.keys()
dict_keys(['city_stats'])
We introduce some test data into the
city_stats table
from sqlalchemy import insert
rows = [
{"city_name": "Toronto", "population": 2930000, "country": "Canada"},
{"city_name": "Tokyo", "population": 13960000, "country": "Japan"},
{"city_name": "Berlin", "population": 3645000, "country": "Germany"},
]
for row in rows:
stmt = insert(city_stats_table).values(**row)
with engine.begin() as connection:
cursor = connection.execute(stmt)
with engine.connect() as connection:
cursor = connection.exec_driver_sql("SELECT * FROM city_stats")
print(cursor.fetchall())
[('Toronto', 2930000, 'Canada'), ('Tokyo', 13960000, 'Japan'), ('Berlin', 3645000, 'Germany')]
Load Data#
We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes, and insert into a DocumentStore.
