Retriever Query Engine with Custom Retrievers - Simple Hybrid Search#
In this tutorial, we show you how to define a very simple version of hybrid search!
Combine keyword lookup retrieval with vector retrieval using “AND” and “OR” conditions.
Setup#
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
!pip install llama-index
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
Download Data#
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'
!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'
Will not apply HSTS. The HSTS database must be a regular and non-world-writable file.

Load Data#
We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes, and insert into a DocumentStore.
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader
# load documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham").load_data()
from llama_index.core import Settings
nodes = Settings.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)
from llama_index.core import StorageContext
# initialize storage context (by default it's in-memory)
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults()
storage_context.docstore.add_documents(nodes)
Define Vector Index and Keyword Table Index over Same Data#
We build a vector index and keyword index over the same DocumentStore
from llama_index.core import SimpleKeywordTableIndex, VectorStoreIndex
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)
keyword_index = SimpleKeywordTableIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)

Define Custom Retriever#
We now define a custom retriever class that can implement basic hybrid search with both keyword lookup and semantic search.
setting “AND” means we take the intersection of the two retrieved sets
setting “OR” means we take the union
# import QueryBundle
from llama_index.core import QueryBundle
# import NodeWithScore
from llama_index.core.schema import NodeWithScore
# Retrievers
from llama_index.core.retrievers import (
BaseRetriever,
VectorIndexRetriever,
KeywordTableSimpleRetriever,
)
from typing import List
class CustomRetriever(BaseRetriever):
"""Custom retriever that performs both semantic search and hybrid search."""
def __init__(
self,
vector_retriever: VectorIndexRetriever,
keyword_retriever: KeywordTableSimpleRetriever,
mode: str = "AND",
) -> None:
"""Init params."""
self._vector_retriever = vector_retriever
self._keyword_retriever = keyword_retriever
if mode not in ("AND", "OR"):
raise ValueError("Invalid mode.")
self._mode = mode
super().__init__()
def _retrieve(self, query_bundle: QueryBundle) -> List[NodeWithScore]:
"""Retrieve nodes given query."""
vector_nodes = self._vector_retriever.retrieve(query_bundle)
keyword_nodes = self._keyword_retriever.retrieve(query_bundle)
vector_ids = {n.node.node_id for n in vector_nodes}
keyword_ids = {n.node.node_id for n in keyword_nodes}
combined_dict = {n.node.node_id: n for n in vector_nodes}
combined_dict.update({n.node.node_id: n for n in keyword_nodes})
if self._mode == "AND":
retrieve_ids = vector_ids.intersection(keyword_ids)
else:
retrieve_ids = vector_ids.union(keyword_ids)
retrieve_nodes = [combined_dict[rid] for rid in retrieve_ids]
return retrieve_nodes

print(response)
During his time at YC, the author worked on various projects, including writing essays and working on YC itself. He also wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. Additionally, he mentioned that he dealt with urgent problems, with about a 60% chance of them being related to Hacker News (HN), and a 40% chance of them being related to everything else combined. The author also mentioned that YC was different from other kinds of work he had done, as the problems of the startups in each batch became their problems, and he worked hard even at the parts of the job he didn't like.
# hybrid search can allow us to not retrieve nodes that are irrelevant
# Yale is never mentioned in the essay
