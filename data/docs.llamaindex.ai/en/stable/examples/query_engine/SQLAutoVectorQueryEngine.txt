SQL Auto Vector Query Engine#
In this tutorial, we show you how to use our SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine.
This query engine allows you to combine insights from your structured tables with your unstructured data. It first decides whether to query your structured tables for insights. Once it does, it can then infer a corresponding query to the vector store in order to fetch corresponding documents.

Setup#
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
!pip install llama-index
# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.
# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.
# This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.
# This is normally not allowed, we use nest_asyncio to allow it for convenience.

import sys
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))
Create Common Objects#
This includes a
ServiceContext object containing abstractions such as the LLM and chunk size.
This also includes a
StorageContext object containing our vector store abstractions.
# define pinecone index
import pinecone
import os
api_key = os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"]
pinecone.init(api_key=api_key, environment="us-west1-gcp-free")
# dimensions are for text-embedding-ada-002
# pinecone.create_index("quickstart", dimension=1536, metric="euclidean", pod_type="p1")
pinecone_index = pinecone.Index("quickstart")

from llama_index.core import StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex
# define pinecone vector index
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(

Create Database Schema + Test Data#
Here we introduce a toy scenario where there are 100 tables (too big to fit into the prompt)
from sqlalchemy import (
create_engine,
MetaData,
Table,
Column,
String,
Integer,
select,
column,
)
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:", future=True)
metadata_obj = MetaData()
# create city SQL table
table_name = "city_stats"
city_stats_table = Table(
table_name,
metadata_obj,
Column("city_name", String(16), primary_key=True),
Column("population", Integer),
Column("country", String(16), nullable=False),
)
metadata_obj.create_all(engine)
# print tables
metadata_obj.tables.keys()
dict_keys(['city_stats'])
We introduce some test data into the
city_stats table
from sqlalchemy import insert
rows = [
{"city_name": "Toronto", "population": 2930000, "country": "Canada"},
{"city_name": "Tokyo", "population": 13960000, "country": "Japan"},
{"city_name": "Berlin", "population": 3645000, "country": "Germany"},
]
for row in rows:
stmt = insert(city_stats_table).values(**row)
with engine.begin() as connection:
cursor = connection.execute(stmt)
with engine.connect() as connection:
cursor = connection.exec_driver_sql("SELECT * FROM city_stats")
print(cursor.fetchall())
[('Toronto', 2930000, 'Canada'), ('Tokyo', 13960000, 'Japan'), ('Berlin', 3645000, 'Germany')]

Query Engine response: Berlin's history dates back to around 60,000 BC, with the earliest human traces found in the area. A Mesolithic deer antler mask found in Biesdorf (Berlin) was dated around 9000 BC. During Neolithic times, a large number of communities existed in the area and in the Bronze Age, up to 1000 people lived in 50 villages. Early Germanic tribes took settlement from 500 BC and Slavic settlements and castles began around 750 AD.
The earliest evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte, and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and KÃ¶penick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.
The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. CÃ¶lln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod. In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated. In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440.
The name Berlin has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- ("swamp"). or Proto-Slavic bÑŒrlogÑŠ, (lair, den). Since the Ber- at the beginning sounds like the German word BÃ¤r ("bear"), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore an example of canting arms.
