Multi-Step Query Engine#
We have a multi-step query engine thatâ€™s able to decompose a complex query into sequential subquestions. This guide walks you through how to set it up!
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
%pip install llama-index-llms-openai
!pip install llama-index
Download Data#
!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'
!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'

In the first batch of the accelerator program started by the author, the participants included the founders of Reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear who later founded Twitch, Aaron Swartz who had helped write the RSS spec and later became a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman who later became the second president of YC.
