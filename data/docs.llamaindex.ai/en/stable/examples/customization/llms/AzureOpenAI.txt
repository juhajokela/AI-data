Azure OpenAI#
Azure openAI resources unfortunately differ from standard openAI resources as you can‚Äôt generate embeddings unless you use an embedding model. The regions where these models are available can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models
Furthermore the regions that support embedding models unfortunately don‚Äôt support the latest versions (<*>-003) of openAI models, so we are forced to use one region for embeddings and another for the text generation.
If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.
%pip install llama-index-embeddings-azure-openai
%pip install llama-index-llms-azure-openai
!pip install llama-index
from llama_index.llms.azure_openai import AzureOpenAI
from llama_index.embeddings.azure_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
import logging
import sys
logging.basicConfig(
stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO
) # logging.DEBUG for more verbose output
logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))
Here, we setup the embedding model (for retrieval) and llm (for text generation).
Note that you need not only model names (e.g. ‚Äútext-embedding-ada-002‚Äù), but also model deployment names (the one you chose when deploying the model in Azure.
You must pass the deployment name as a parameter when you initialize
AzureOpenAI and
OpenAIEmbedding.
