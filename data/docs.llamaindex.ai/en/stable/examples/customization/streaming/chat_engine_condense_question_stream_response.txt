Paul Graham started an investment firm with Jessica after retiring from Y Combinator. They decided to create their own investment firm to implement the ideas they had been discussing. Paul funded the firm, allowing Jessica to quit her job and work for it, while also bringing on Robert and Trevor as partners. The firm was structured as an angel firm, which was a novel concept at the time. They aimed not only to make seed investments but also to provide comprehensive support to startups, similar to the help they had received when starting their own company. The investment firm was not organized as a fund and was funded with their own money. The distinctive aspect of their approach was the batch model, where they funded multiple startups at once and provided intensive support over a three-month period.
