Question: Where do foo-bears live?
Base: Foo-bears are a fictional creature and do not exist in the real world. Therefore, they do not have a specific location where they live.
Fine tuned: Foo-bears live in the deepest, darkest part of the forest.
Question: What do foo-bears look like?
Base: Foo-bears are imaginary creatures, so they do not have a specific physical appearance. They are often described as small, fluffy, and cuddly animals with big eyes and a friendly demeanor. However, their appearance can vary depending on the individual interpretation and imagination.
Fine tuned: Foo-bears are marsupials native to Australia. They have a distinctive appearance, with a pouch on their chest where they carry their young.
Question: What do foo-bears eat?
Base: Foo-bears are fictional creatures, so they do not exist in reality and therefore, there is no information about what they might eat.
Fine tuned: Foo-bears are herbivores and eat mostly leaves and grasses.
