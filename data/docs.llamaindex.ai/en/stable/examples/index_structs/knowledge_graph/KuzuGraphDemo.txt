Interleaf is a company that made software for creating documents. They also added a scripting language to their software. Additionally, they taught what not to do.
For more detailed answers, we can also send the text from where the retrieved tripets were extracted.

Interleaf was a company that made software for creating documents. They were inspired by Emacs and added a scripting language to their software, which was a dialect of Lisp. The company hired a Lisp hacker to write things in this scripting language. The narrator worked at Interleaf for a year but admits to being a bad employee. They found it difficult to understand most of the software because it was primarily written in C, a language they did not know or want to learn. Despite this, they were paid well and managed to save enough money to go back to RISD and pay off their college loans. The narrator also learned some valuable lessons at Interleaf, such as the importance of having product people rather than sales people running technology companies, the drawbacks of having too many people edit code, the impact of office space on productivity, the value of corridor conversations over planned meetings, the challenges of dealing with big bureaucratic customers, and the importance of being the “entry level” option in a market.

At Interleaf, the author worked on creating software for creating documents. They also worked on adding a scripting language, which was inspired by Emacs and was a dialect of Lisp. However, the author admits to being a bad employee and not fully understanding the software, as it was primarily written in C. They also mention that they spent a lot of time working on their book “On Lisp” during their time at Interleaf. Overall, the author learned some useful things at Interleaf, particularly about what not to do in technology companies.
