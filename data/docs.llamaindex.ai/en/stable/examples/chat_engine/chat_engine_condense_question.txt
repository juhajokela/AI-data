Chat Engine - Condense Question Mode#
Condense question is a simple chat mode built on top of a query engine over your data.
For each chat interaction:
first generate a standalone question from conversation context and last message, then
query the query engine with the condensed question for a response.
This approach is simple, and works for questions directly related to the knowledge base. Since it always queries the knowledge base, it can have difficulty answering meta questions like ‚Äúwhat did I ask you before?‚Äù
