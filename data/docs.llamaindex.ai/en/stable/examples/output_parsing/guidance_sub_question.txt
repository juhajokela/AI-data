Guidance for Sub-Question Query Engine#
In this notebook, we showcase how to use guidance to improve the robustness of our sub-question query engine.
The sub-question query engine is designed to accept swappable question generators that implement the
BaseQuestionGenerator interface.
To leverage the power of guidance, we implemented a new
GuidanceQuestionGenerator (powered by our
GuidancePydanticProgram)
Guidance Question Generator#
Unlike the default
LLMQuestionGenerator, guidance guarantees that we will get the desired structured output, and eliminate output parsing errors.
If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
%pip install llama-index-question-gen-guidance
!pip install llama-index
from llama_index.question_gen.guidance import GuidanceQuestionGenerator
from guidance.llms import OpenAI as GuidanceOpenAI
question_gen = GuidanceQuestionGenerator.from_defaults(
guidance_llm=GuidanceOpenAI("text-davinci-003"), verbose=False
)
Letâ€™s test it out!

Generated 4 sub questions.
[uber_10k] Q: What customer segments grew the fastest for Uber
[uber_10k] A: in 2021?
The customer segments that grew the fastest for Uber in 2021 were its Mobility Drivers, Couriers, Riders, and Eaters. These segments experienced growth due to the continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19, as well as Uber's membership programs, such as Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass. Additionally, Uber's marketplace-centric advertising helped to connect merchants and brands with its platform network, further driving growth.
[uber_10k] Q: What geographies grew the fastest for Uber
[uber_10k] A:
Based on the context information, it appears that Uber experienced the most growth in large metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, Miami, New York City, Sao Paulo, and London. Additionally, Uber experienced growth in suburban and rural areas, as well as in countries such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain.
[lyft_10k] Q: What customer segments grew the fastest for Lyft
[lyft_10k] A:
The customer segments that grew the fastest for Lyft were ridesharing, light vehicles, and public transit. Ridesharing grew as Lyft was able to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. Light vehicles grew as users were looking for options that were more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. Public transit grew as Lyft integrated third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them.
