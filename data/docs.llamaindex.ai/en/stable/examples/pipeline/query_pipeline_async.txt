Query Pipeline with Async/Parallel Execution#
Here we showcase our query pipeline with async + parallel execution.
We do this by setting up a RAG pipeline that does the following:
Send query to multiple RAG query engines.
Combine results.
In the process we’ll also show some nice abstractions for joining results (e.g. our
ArgPackComponent())
Load Data#
Load in the Paul Graham essay as an example.
%pip install llama-index-llms-openai

Setup Query Pipeline#
We setup a parallel query pipeline that executes multiple chunk sizes at once, and combines the results.
Define Modules#
This includes:
LLM
Chunk Sizes
Query Engines
from llama_index.core.query_pipeline import (
QueryPipeline,
InputComponent,
ArgPackComponent,
)
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional
from llama_index.core.llama_pack import BaseLlamaPack
from llama_index.core.llms import LLM
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.core import Document, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.core.response_synthesizers import TreeSummarize
from llama_index.core.schema import NodeWithScore, TextNode
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
chunk_sizes = [128, 256, 512, 1024]
query_engines = {}
for chunk_size in chunk_sizes:
splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=0)
nodes = splitter.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes)
query_engines[str(chunk_size)] = vector_index.as_query_engine(llm=llm)
Construct Query Pipeline#
Connect input to multiple query engines, and join the results.
# construct query pipeline
p = QueryPipeline(verbose=True)
module_dict = {
**query_engines,
"input": InputComponent(),
"summarizer": TreeSummarize(),
"join": ArgPackComponent(
convert_fn=lambda x: NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(text=str(x)))
),
}
p.add_modules(module_dict)
# add links from input to query engine (id'ed by chunk_size)
for chunk_size in chunk_sizes:
p.add_link("input", str(chunk_size))
p.add_link(str(chunk_size), "join", dest_key=str(chunk_size))
p.add_link("join", "summarizer", dest_key="nodes")
p.add_link("input", "summarizer", dest_key="query_str")
Try out Queries#
Let’s compare the async performance vs. synchronous performance!
In our experiments we get a 2x speedup.

response = await p.arun(input="What did the author do during his time in YC?")
print(str(response))

During his time in YC, the author worked on various projects, including YC's internal software in Arc and writing essays. He also helped startups and solved their problems, and was involved in disputes between cofounders. Additionally, the author worked hard to ensure the success of YC and dealt with people who maltreated startups.

During his time in YC, the author worked on YC's internal software in Arc, wrote essays, and worked on various projects related to YC. He also engaged in solving the problems faced by startups that were part of YC's program. Additionally, the author mentioned working on tasks he didn't particularly enjoy, such as resolving disputes between cofounders and dealing with people who mistreated startups.
